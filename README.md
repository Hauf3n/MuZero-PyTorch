# MuZero PyTorch
 Implementation of MuZero | CartPole <br><br>
 
 MuZero + naive-tree-search (instead of MCTS) is working.<br>
 Work in progress ...<br>
 Current issue: MCTS seems to make problems ... <br>
 
 # Naive tree search results
 Search in the fully expanded tree at depth n the maximum discounted value (+ discounted rewards).<br>
 Take the action which is the first action from the root to the maximum node.<br>
